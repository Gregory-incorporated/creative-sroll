#  Parallax-Powered Portfolio Website

 This portfolio website is a showcase of my skills and creativity, designed to captivate and engage visitors with its visually stunning and interactive parallax effect. The parallax effect is a design technique that creates a sense of depth and movement by allowing the background to move at a slower pace than the foreground as the user scrolls down the page. 

 - GSAP for animation
